# Description
This is the API back-end for the Two Wheels Stable web application, which is designed for motorcycle enthusiasts. It allows users to register their accounts and the motorcycles they have. They can upload pictures of their bikes, create a schedule for the maintenance jobs and get notifications, whenever a job is due. Users can comment on each otherâ€™s bikes as well.
